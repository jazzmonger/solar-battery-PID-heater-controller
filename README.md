ESPHome PID heating pad controller for LifePO4 batteries

Some of us live in very cold climates and LifePO4 batteries don't do well below freezing. In fact, you can destroy your batteries by charging them when they're near 0 C. We have too much $ invested in our packs to not take good care of them.

I bought these heaters and they work great:

LifePO4 120v battery heater mats - work well!
These seem to work really well: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TM6SSP7?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details they almost cover the entire bottom of each rack mount battery. I got them and set up an automation in Home Assistant on 12/22 to keep them between 50-60F.
